						At Fixity, we believe family is everything and understand the importance of maintaining connections with your loved ones. But in today's rapidly transforming digital world, staying connected with your loved ones can be a challenge, especially for older generations. The older generations of the family are often not much fluent with technology. For them using digital technology to stay connected with the younger generation of the family can be a difficult task. This inspired us to create Legacy, an easy-to-use application that makes it simple for everyone in the family to stay in touch.
